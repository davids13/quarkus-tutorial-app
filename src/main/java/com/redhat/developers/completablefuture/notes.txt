what async means?
    - Asynchronous programming is a means of writing non-blocking code by
      running a task on a separate thread than the main application thread
      and notifying the main thread about its progress, completion or failure.
      This way, your main thread does not block/wait for the completion of the task, and it can execute other tasks in parallel.
